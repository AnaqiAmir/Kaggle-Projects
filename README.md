# Kaggle Projects

This repository contains various Kaggle projects I have worked on. Each project has its own directory within the repository, containing the code, datasets, and any additional resources used for analysis and model development.

## Projects
1. Chess Games ([link](https://github.com/AnaqiAmir/Kaggle-Projects/tree/main/Chess%20Games))
   * Project Overview: Conducted analysis on how different openings in chess games affect the outcome of the games.
   * Tags: `EDA`, `Classification`, `Data Visualization`
2. Data Science Salaries ([link](https://github.com/AnaqiAmir/Kaggle-Projects/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Salaries))
   * Project Overview: Analyzed how different job titles, experience levels, and employment types of employees determine their salaries. Build a regression model to predict those salaries based on the aforementioned features.
   * Tags: `Linear Regression`, `Data Analysis`
3. House Price Predicion ([link](https://github.com/AnaqiAmir/Kaggle-Projects/tree/main/House%20Price%20Predictions))
   * Project Overview: Developed models that accurately predict the final sale price of homes based on a variety of different features including area of the house, number of bedrooms, quality of materials used, location, and more.
   * Tags: `Data Cleaning`, `Feature Selection`, `Linear Regression`, `Kaggle Competition`
4. Spaceship Titanic Classification ([link](https://github.com/AnaqiAmir/Kaggle-Projects/tree/main/Titanice%20Spaceship%20Classification))
   * Project Overview: Created a Decision Tree Classifier to classify whether passengers were transported to another dimension or not based on features such as home planet, destination, cabin number, and more. This is an alternate version of the famous Titanic dataset.
   * Tags: `Classification`, `Feature Engineeing`,  `Model Selection`, `Hyperparameter Tuning`, `Kaggle Competition`
5. CO2 Emissions ([link](https://github.com/AnaqiAmir/Kaggle-Projects/tree/main/CO2%20Emissions%20Prediction))
   * Project Overview: Predicted the CO2 emission in Rwanda based on information of other chemicals.
   * Tags: `EDA`, `Outlier Analysis`, `Model Selection`, `Kaggle Competition`
